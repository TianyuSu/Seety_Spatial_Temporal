# Spatial-Temporal Big Data for Urban Human Behavior

This is a project of Dr Tianyu Su, which has been supported by the following researchers over the years (listed alphabetically):

* Maoran Sun
* Zhuangyuan Fan

The purpose of this project is to develop machine learning-aided data mining methods to detect human behavioral patterns using large-scale spatial-temporal data. The methods are then applied to different areas including urban science, public health, and transportation.

## Data sources (ranked by priority; up to January 2024)
* High-resolution mobile phone GPS data
* High-resolution smart card tap-in data
* Longitudinal transportation surveys
* Time user surveys
